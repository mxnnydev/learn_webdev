    <!-- Use <div> as a generic block-level container when no semantic element fits -->
    <!-- Commonly used to group multiple elements or apply layout styling -->
    <div>
      <!-- This is an empty <div>; typically used to wrap other nested elements -->
    </div>

    <!-- <span> is an inline element used for styling small portions of text -->
    <span>Text</span>

    <!-- <span> is often placed inside headings or paragraphs to style specific words -->
    <h1>
      Hello Good Morning, my favorite color is
      <!-- Here we style only the word "red" using an inline <span> element -->
      <span style="color: lightcoral">red</span>
    </h1>

    <!-- 
      Key difference between block and inline elements:
      - Block elements (like <div>) take up the full width of the parent container
      - Inline elements (like <span>) only take up as much width as their content
      There is also a hybrid: 'inline-block', which behaves like inline but respects width, height, padding, and margins like block
      Using CSS, we can change the display behavior of any element (e.g., from inline to block and vice versa)
