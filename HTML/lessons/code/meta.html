    <h1>Lesson: The Head & Meta Tags in HTML</h1>
    <p>
      This page shows how to use the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of HTML
      properly. The head acts like the control center — it holds metadata and
      tells the browser how to handle the page.
    </p>

    <p>
      External CSS is linked in the head, while external JavaScript is best
      placed at the end of the body for better page loading performance.
