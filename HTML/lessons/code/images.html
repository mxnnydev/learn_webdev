    <h1>Lesson: How to Add Images in HTML</h1>

    <!-- 
      The <img> tag is used to display images in HTML. 
      It is a self-closing tag and requires at least two key attributes:
        1. src: Specifies the path or URL to the image file (including its extension).
        2. alt: Provides alternative text for screen readers or if the image fails to load. 
      This improves accessibility and ensures all users can interact with your content.
    -->
    <img src="#" alt="Describe the image here" />

    <!-- 
      You can use both local image paths (e.g., 'images/photo.jpg') 
      or direct URLs to externally hosted images (e.g., 'https://example.com/image.png').
