    "> **Positioning controls how an element *breaks away* from the normal flow of the page and where it sits in relation to others.**\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, every element flows like text in a Word document ‚Äî block by block, top to bottom. When we use `position`, we change how it *breaks out* of that flow.\n",

    "### 1. `static` ‚Äì **The Default (Don‚Äôt Move Me)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* üì¶ In flow, no offsets (`top`, `left`, etc.) will apply.\n",
    "* ‚ùå You can‚Äôt control its position with `top`, `left`, etc.\n",
    "* ‚úÖ Used 95% of the time unless overridden.\n",

    "* Element stays in the flow but moves relative to where it would have been.\n",
    "* Doesn‚Äôt affect others ‚Äî it leaves a ‚Äúghost‚Äù of its original spot.\n",

    "* If no ancestor is positioned ‚Üí relative to `<html>`/`<body>`.\n",

    "* Acts like `relative` until it reaches a threshold (like `top: 0`), then behaves like `fixed`.\n",
